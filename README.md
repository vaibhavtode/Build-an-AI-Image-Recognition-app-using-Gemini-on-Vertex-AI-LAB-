# Build-an-AI-Image-Recognition-app-using-Gemini-on-Vertex-AI-LAB-
This Repo is a Fixed version of the Lab "Build an AI Image Recognition app using Gemini on Vertex AI" which dosent allow to submit the changes 

Tried a fix for this Lab and its working and changes getting Submitted.

The Fix: Instead of directly giving input from cloudbucket url, Download the File locally and then use that file in the input prompt. This solves the problem and Lab will get submitted.

just copy paste the code i have mentioned in the "genai.py" file on to your terminal. 

set the environment variables as mentioned in the LAB.
